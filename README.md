## How to run the code?
Step-1: Build the code using the command "make" or "make all". 
If the system you are running the code has multiple processors, 
one can use the command "make -j <number of processors>". (this reduces the build time).

Step-2: Run the code using the command "./main <JOB-HOME-FOLDER> <JOB-INPUT-FILE-NAME>"
